# knots
Programs to make knots

You can get recipes for column coded (turks heads, spanish ring, headhunter, gaucho), row coded, 
standard herringbone pineapple knots, or perfect herringbone pineapple knots.
These programs are all based on articles and books by A.G. Schaake.

The programs are written in C++. Use make to compile and link. The makefile provided is for gcc.

The input files are the .in files.

If you uncomment the line //undef LOCAL in the source codes (and re-make)
you can enter the input on the command line.
