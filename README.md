Programs to make knots
You can get recipes for column coded (turks heads, spanish ring, headhunter, gaucho), row coded, 
standard herringbone pineapple knots, or perfect herringbone pineapple knots.
These programs are all based on articles and books by A.G. Schaake. If you want to use the programs send me a message and 
I will explain their use.
